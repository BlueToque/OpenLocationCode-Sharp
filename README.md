# OpenLocationCode-Sharp
A port of Google's OpenLocationCode to C#

Open Location Codes are a way of encoding location into a form that is easier to use than latitude and longitude. They are designed to be used like street addresses, especially in places where buildings aren't numbered or streets aren't named.

The system works algorithmically, which means it works offline and online. Similar codes are in similar areas of the earth. This system can be very useful under certain circumstances.
